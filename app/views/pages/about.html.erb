The realm has seen its fair share of strife and war, but currently its inhabitants live in an era of peace. <br> <br> That is precisely why so many mercenaries, soldiers of fortune, grave-robbers, and even adventurous nobles have banded together in search of fame, glory, and riches. When there is no adventure to be found at home, one can be certain that in the outskirts and the wilds, there is much treasure and danger to be found.</p></div>

Born an orphan in the streets of the capital, she has learned to fend for herself since a young age, and when rumors of a vast treasure began circulating, she saw the opportunity for one last job that would mean her retirement. </p>

He is out for himself first and foremost, and any ally of his would do well to remember that, in the grand scheme of things, all alliances with this man last only as long as mutual interests align. His musical gifts and silver tongue also allow him to be a womanizer of the worst sort, and he is often in trouble at tarverns and bars.</p>

Having left his home in search of riches and adventure in faraway lands, he found a home in the band of misfits called The Dead Men. While being the only dwarf in these lands might sound lonely, Jorek has not lost his friendly demeanor, dwarven taste for ale, nor his hearty laugh, often heard when he encounters a peculiar custom that he is not accostumed to. </p>

Recently, however, she heard rumors about a legendary treasure that a dragon stole from the elves in ages past, and decided that not only humans need to atone for their past crimes against her people. </p>
